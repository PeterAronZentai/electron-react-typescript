# Electron React Typescript quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to start an Electron app using React in TypeScript.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the
[Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

## Things cared for
- `npm run build` to build all from typescript
- all components: `main`, `renderer` and `tests` are in typescript
- typings
- tslint
- basic store+action example
- mocha/jsdom test framework with an example
